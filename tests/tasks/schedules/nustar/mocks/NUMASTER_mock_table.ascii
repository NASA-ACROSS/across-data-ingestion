The X-ray variability is hypothesized to be caused by onset of two accretion modes: quasi-spherical (small flares) and free-fall (large flares). Increased absorption during dips suggests clumps, while low luminosity phases hint at the propeller regime. Previous NICER/Chandra monitoring could not constrain the source's spin period. NuSTAR's large photon collecting area over broadband energies is vital for interpreting the physics of this enigmatic source that has puzzled the X-ray binary community since discovery."

Here, we propose simultaneous 3x40ks NuSTAR and 3x20ks XMM-Newton monitoring campaign of SGR 1935+2154 to establish its current temporal and spectral properties post-outburst, during a seemingly quiet period, and how that compares to the quiescent state of the source established in 2014."
